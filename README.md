# DO NOT USE THIS GITHUB ACTION

This is a proof-of-concept created to explore the permissions granted to github actions by default

Note that this is **NOT** the recommended way to push to the repo from a github action. You should probably use [actions/checkout@v2](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout#push-a-commit-using-the-built-in-token)
